The purpose of this repo is to run the scripts for the analysis in the CCR paper, main figures and supplemental figures, as well as numbers calculations for the paper itself.  If you run `bash figurescripts.sh` on the cluster everything should be generated.  As of this moment, the current design requires everything to be on the kingspeak cluster in the lustre file storage and the exacresiduals repo (for the generation of the model) to be inside of this repo's folder.  Also, the folder should be named analysis to keep the code consistent for now.
